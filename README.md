# CSharp-Certification

I'm building this repo to store my codes and projects of the "Foundational C# with Microsoft Certification" course, made by Microsoft partnered with freeCodeCamp.
I'll constantly upload new files.

This repo consists of 2 Main Folders:
Code➡️ where all the C# code is stored, alongside some project folders. Some of the projects are built within the course while others are ideas or simple tests, to practice some logic and code as seen in the course.

Markdown ➡️ where i'm storing written files containing resumes of the content provided throughout the course.
